# AGENTS.md

## Local execution

Mac set this on 2026-09-26 for every repository on this machine. Local builds, test runs, dev servers, and git hooks ran the laptop out of memory and killed agent runs partway through, and every killed run costs money. CI is the only place code is built, checked, or tested.

- Do not run the gate, a build, a typecheck, a lint, or any test, not even one test file. Push the branch and read the CI result. Read a failed job with `gh run view --job <id> --log-failed`.
- Do not start a dev server: no `next dev`, `next start`, `pnpm dev`, a server under `cargo run`, or anything else that listens on a port.
- Do not start Docker or Colima, and do not run anything that needs them.
- Do not run Biome in any form.
- Git hooks are off on this machine. `LEFTHOOK=0` and `HUSKY=0` are set for every shell and every Claude Code session. Do not reinstall a hook, turn one back on, or run a hook's commands by hand.
- Code generators and small integrity scripts that only read and write files are allowed, such as regenerating a checksum, a schema index, or a message catalogue.
- Put this rule, word for word, in the prompt of every subagent you start.
